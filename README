MISSION STATEMENT
Groove is a personal habit tracker to help you get into the groove of your desired habit. When trying to develop a new routine or habit, it’s important to be intentional about it. That’s where Groove comes into place. The creation of Groove was born out of a new appreciation for setting goals and achieving said goals step by step instead of getting lost in the big picture. I knew this would be an app I would want to use, and figured there would be no better reason to create something.

DESCRIPTION
Groove allows you to create customizable habits and frequencies with which you build you own Habit configuration. You are then able to create a "Daily Log" tracker each time you complete your habit for the day. You also have access to see the history of your daily logs to keep track of said habit.
